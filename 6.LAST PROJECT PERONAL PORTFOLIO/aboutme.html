            <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
            <P>Hello there! Iâ€™m an enthusiastic front-end developer with a passion for creating stunning digital
                experiences. My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how websites come to life, and since
                then, I've been captivated by the process. With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy
                transforming complex ideas into intuitive, user-friendly applications.</P>

            <P>My time at the Digital Empowerment Network was truly transformative. Working with a dynamic team, I had
                the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects, developing responsive websites and innovative
                digital solutions. We prioritized accessibility and user engagement, which sharpened my technical skills
                and expanded my understanding of how technology can drive social change. This experience profoundly
                shaped my approach to front-end development.

            .</P>

            <P> I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and constantly seek new challenges that push me beyond my
                comfort zone. Whether it's exploring the latest frameworks or diving into UI/UX design, I embrace every
                chance to grow. I aim to merge creativity with technology in every project, ensuring that my work is not
                only functional but also visually captivating.
            </P>
